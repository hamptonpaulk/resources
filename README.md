## Naming Conventions

### Research Papers

To maintain consistency and discoverability, research papers follow these naming patterns:

**ArXiv Papers**: `author-title-YYMM.NNNNN.pdf`
- Lead author surname (lowercase)
- Main title (no subtitle, lowercase, hyphen-separated)
- Full ArXiv identifier at end
- Example: `brown-language-models-are-few-shot-learners-2005.14165.pdf`

**Non-ArXiv Papers**: `author-title-year.pdf`
- Lead author surname (lowercase)
- Main title or short descriptive title (lowercase, hyphen-separated)
- Publication year
- Example: `rosenblatt-the-perceptron-1958.pdf`

**Descriptive Papers**: `descriptive-title.pdf`
- For papers without clear metadata or when preserving a well-known title
- All lowercase with hyphens
- Example: `dijkstra-on-the-foolishness-of-natural-language-programming-1978.pdf`

### Plain-text Resources

**Format**: `author-title-year.txt`
- All lowercase
- Hyphens separate words
- Year at end
- Example: `emerson-self-reliance-1841.txt`

### Videos

**Folder structure**: `YYYYMMDD_event-type_description/`
- Date prefix for chronological sorting
